    "\n",
    "Seeing as you’ve managed to access this webpage, you should already know what a computer is. Today, computers take many forms: From laptops and phones to the systems controlling traffic lights. It seems computers can do anything! These systems can be very complex and specialised, but they all have one thing in common: A computer carries out a set of instructions on some input information to give us some new (output) information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructions we give computers need to be very specific and unambiguous. We call these sets of instructions _algorithms,_ and a lot of the research into computers is into the behaviour of different algorithms. In this course, we will only consider computers in their simplest form; no keyboards, mice, or screens- just information and algorithms.\n",

    "## Classifying computer algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the role of quantum computers amongst modern traditional computers, we first need to learn how we classify different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, we classify algorithms on how the [resources](gloss:resources) they use grow with the size of the input. We call this the algorithm’s complexity. For example, an algorithm that decides if a number is even only needs to look at the last digit in that number. In this case, the ‘input’ is a number, and the output is either ‘Even’ or ‘Odd’. We call this a _constant time_ algorithm, because the time the algorithm takes to complete does not depend on the size of the input number. It might take different computers different amounts of time to get this result, but that’s due to other factors and not the length of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Animation following through the steps of an algorithm that works out if a number is even or odd](images/why-qc/odd_even_algo.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at a different example. This time, we are given (as input) two numbers of equal length and the problem is to add them together. In this case the output will be a new number. When adding two multi-digit numbers, a common algorithm you probably learnt at school starts with the rightmost digit from each number and adds them together. It then moves one digit to the left (carrying over a ‘1’ if the result was greater than 9) and repeats the process. This is repeated until there are no more digits to add, and the algorithm ends.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s say the only way we can check if our answer is correct is by punching it into a keypad. Since we have no information about what that number might be, the best algorithm to find this secret number uses a ‘brute-force’ method, which means it does nothing clever and simply tries every possible number. So how long would this take? Statistically, we expect we would need to try around half the possible combinations before we happen across the correct number, so the running time of our algorithm is proportional to the number of possible combinations. The question now becomes: How does the number of possible combinations grow with the length of the secret number?\n",

    "![Animation showing the steps of a brute-force search algorithm](images/why-qc/search_algo.gif)\n",

    "A secret number with 1 digit has 10 possible values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9), and a secret number with 2 digits has 100 possible values. Generally, each digit we add to our secret number multiplies the number of possible combinations by 10. Assuming the time taken to guess each password takes the same amount of time (regardless of the length), we can represent this mathematically like so:\n",

    "\n",

    "## Why do we measure algorithms like this?\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve now seen that we can measure algorithms by how they grow with the size of their input, and we’ve seen some examples of different types of growth. But why is this interesting to us?\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about the ‘speed’ of an algorithm is difficult as there are many different factors that affect the time it takes to compute something. Measuring algorithms in this way lets us to ignore any device-specific details and think about the underlying logic behind the algorithm. Importantly, knowing how an algorithm scales with input size tells us whether the algorithm will grow manageably or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s think about the linear-time addition algorithm we saw above: If we could add two 10-digit numbers in one second, due to the linear rate of growth, we should be able to add two 20-digit numbers in two seconds. Each extra 10 digits should add roughly one more second to our computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, if we could find a 10-digit PIN in 1 second using our exponential-time search algorithm, we would expect it to take roughly 10,000,000,000 seconds (317 years) to find a 20-digit PIN. Adding another 10 digits, we would expect the algorithm to take around 3,170,000,000,000 years (~240x the age of the universe) to complete. We can see exponential algorithms with even a modestly sized input (in this case ~30 digits) can become not just difficult, but literally impossible to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this PIN-finding problem is an artificial example intended to be as simple as possible, there are many real problems in computer science for which we only have inefficient algorithms. Despite the impressive speed of today’s computers, these [intractable](gloss:intractable) problems can be too difficult for even the largest supercomputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we can find algorithms that grow more efficiently, these intractable problems may suddenly become manageable, even with relatively slow or unreliable computers, and this is where quantum computing comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can quantum computing help?\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics is an attempt to describe the behaviour of the world around us. Around the early 20th century, through delicate experiments in laboratories, physicists saw strange behaviours which their current understanding of physics could not explain. These discoveries led to the development of the more complete ‘quantum’ physics, which was able to describe this behaviour very successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have thought of algorithms in a very abstract way, but the computers that execute these algorithms must exist in the real world. Whether these computers are high-powered microchips, or humans with pens and paper, all computers are ultimately governed by the laws of physics, and the operations they can perform limit the algorithms we can create.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum physics was created to explain behaviour previously thought impossible, and computer scientists found that this newly discovered behaviour could be exploited to create algorithms with better complexities. As a result, there are certain problems that we believe are intractable for conventional computers, but are manageable for a ‘quantum’ computer that can exploit this behaviour. One such problem is _integer factorisation._\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have an integer, $x$. Factorisation is the process of finding the integers that multiply to make $x$, i.e. find integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p×q = x$. This is easy in some cases; you can tell at a glance that $2000 = 2 × 1000$, but if $x$ is the product of two large prime numbers, this problem becomes very difficult. When we talk about integer factorisation, we’re going to assume the most difficult (worst-case) scenario. In the code cell below, we’re assigning a 250-digit number to the variable <code>rsa_250</code>:\n"

If we don’t have enough qubits, we simply can’t store and operate on problems above a certain size. The second is the error rate of our quantum computer; since we only see quantum behaviour in delicate laboratory experiments, creating quantum computers is a delicate process.
