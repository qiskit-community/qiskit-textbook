    "\n",
    "## Entangled states and simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully describe the state of $n$ qubits, we need to keep track of $2^n$ amplitudes. Since these vectors grow exponentially with the number of qubits, quantum computers with large numbers of qubits become very difficult to simulate. A modern laptop can easily simulate a general quantum state of around 20 qubits, but simulating 100 qubits is too difficult for the largest supercomputers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this statement is true in general, there are important exceptions. For example, suppose we begin in a product state. This means that each qubit can be independently described by a single qubit state with two amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we perform a circuit with only single qubit gates. These manipulations can be easily described by modifying the single qubit states, which means making changes to the specific pairs of amplitudes affected. Then, when each qubit is measured, the probability of the outcome `0` or `1` for each qubit are determined by their respective amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this while process, the states remained product states. As such there was never truly an $n$-qubit computation, but rather $n$ separate single qubit computations. This makes it possible to keep track of everything with a very managable $2 n$ amplitudes, rather than the full $2^n$. For such situations, simulating thousands of qubits would be easy even for your phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful quantum algorithms will need to be able to do things that classical computers cannot simulate. They must therefore work in a way that prevents tricks like this from being found. They must involve more complex manipulations of the qubits, creating states for which there are no easy shortcuts. This means that they must use states for which the full $2^n$ amplitude description is needed, and so will need to involve more than just product states. And since anything that is not a product state is an entangled state, we find that entanglement is a neccessary ingredient of any quantum advantage."

    "### The uncertainty principle\n",
    "\n",
    "All these results are the consequence of the uncertainty principle discovered by Werner Heisenberg, which is one of the most important aspects of quantum mechanics. It states that for certain pairs of attributes of a quantum system, it is impossible to know both with certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not true of the color and shape of an object, as in our example before. As we know from everyday experience, knowing exactly what shape something is does not cause its color to become random.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true, however, for the outcomes of z and x measurements. These are two different ways that we could choose to encode a bit of information in a qubit. We can do it the normal way, using the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states to encode the bit values `0` and `1` and using the z measurement to read it out. Or we could do it an alternative way, using the $|+\\rangle$ and $|-\\rangle$ states to encode the bit values and the x measurement for read out. But the uncertainty principle makes sure that we can't do both at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speficially, for the z measurements we can define a quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle Z \\rangle = p_z(0) - p_z(1),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p_z(0)$ is the probability of the outcome `0`, and $p_z(1)$ is the probability of `1`. This quantity reaches its maximum value of $1$ for a state that is certain to output `0`, and its minimum value of $-1$ for a state certain to output `1`. Note that in both of these cases where the output is certain, $\\langle Z \\rangle^2 = 1$. For a completely random result, however, we would find $\\langle Z \\rangle = \\langle Z \\rangle^2 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can similarly define the quantity $\\langle X \\rangle$ for the outcomes of x measurements. For these we can find that, for any valid statevector\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle Z \\rangle^2 + \\langle X \\rangle^2 \\leq 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the uncertainty principle for a qubit, specifically how much certainty can be shared between these kinds of measurement."

    "## 3.4 Unique quantum correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "With the notions of these different measurement bases, we can start to look at unique correlations that are possible for qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's again consider our friends Alice, Bob and Charlie. Charlie creates a particular entangled state and sends one qubit to Alice and the other to Bob. They make measurements and compare the results. Then Charlie sends another, identically prepared state. This repeats many times, so Alice and Bob can build up statistics on all the different measurement results.\n",

    "With this information, Alice and Bob can begin to speculate about what would happen if they both performed an x measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can summarize their results so far in the following two observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If z measurements are made on both qubits, they never both output `0`;\n",
    "2. If an x measurement of one qubit outputs `1`, a z measurement of the other will output `0` (because the `11` result never occurs in these cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "These correspond exactly to the observations made for the colored shapes in the classical scenario. If we apply the same logic as we did in that case, we can analyse the case where both Alice and Bob make an x measurement, and they both get the result `1`. Bob would then be able to apply observation 2 and infer that, Alice would certainly have gotten a `0` if she had instead done a z measurement. Alice can do the same, inferring that Bob would have gotten a `1` if he'd have made a z measurement. So together they conclude that, if they had both made z measurements, they would both have gotten the output `0`. Since observation 1 shows us that such a result would be impossible, Alice and Bob could predict that the `11` result will never occur.\n",
