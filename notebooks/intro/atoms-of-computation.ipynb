    "These questions can be answered by making comparisons to traditional digital computers. Unfortunately, most people don’t actually understand how traditional digital computers work either. On this page, we’ll look at the basic principles behind these traditional devices, and to help us transition over to quantum computing later on, we’ll do it using the same tools we'll use with quantum computers.\n",

    "\n",
    "One example is numbers. You are probably used to representing a number through a string of the ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In this string of digits, each digit represents how many times the number contains a certain power of ten. For example, when we write 9213, we mean:\n",

    "\n",
    "Though we usually use this system based on the number 10, we can just as easily use one based on any other number. The binary number system, for example, is based on the number two. This means using the two characters 0 and 1 to express numbers as multiples of powers of two. For example, 9213 becomes 10001111111101, since:\n",

For any letter, number, or punctuation mark you want to use, you can find a corresponding string of at most eight bits using [this table](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=adapters-ascii-decimal-hexadecimal-octal-binary-conversion-table).

In the rest of this textbook, we will explore what qubits are, what they can do, and how they do it. In this section, however, we are not talking about quantum at all.
