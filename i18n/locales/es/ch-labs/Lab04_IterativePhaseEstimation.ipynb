In Lab 4, we learn one such algorithm for estimating quantum phase called the Iterative Phase Estimation (IPE) algorithm which requires a system comprised of only a single ancillary qubit and evaluate the phase through a repetative process.

    "The Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) circuit that we have learned and used previously is limited by the number of qubits necessary for the algorithmâ€™s precision.  Every additional qubit has added costs in terms of noise and hardware requirements; noisy results that we obtained from executing the QPE circuit on a real quantum device in Lab 3 would get worse as the number of the qubits on the circuit increases. The IPE algorithm implements quantum phase estimation with only a single ancillary qubit, and the accuracy of the algorithm is restricted by the number of iterations rather than the number of counting qubits. Therefore, IPE circuits are of practical interest and are of foremost importance for near-term quantum computing as QPE is an essential element in many quantum algorithms."

Having them initialized as $q_0 \\rightarrow |+\\rangle$ and $q_1 \\rightarrow |\\Psi \\rangle$, application of control-U between $q_0$ and $q_1$ $2^t$ times would change the state of $q_0$ to $|0\\rangle + e^{i 2 \\pi 2^{t} \\varphi} | 1 \\rangle$.
