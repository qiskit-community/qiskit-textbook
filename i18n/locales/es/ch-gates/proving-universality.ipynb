If a device can perform any such conversion, taking any arbitrary set of inputs and converting them to an arbitrarily chosen set of corresponding outputs, we call it *universal*.\n",

    "This method continues to work as we increase the number of qubits, and also the number of terms that need simulating. Care must be taken to ensure that the approximation remains accurate, but this can be done in ways that require reasonable resources. Adding extra terms to simulate, or increasing the desired accuracy, only require the complexity of the method to increase polynomially.\n",

    "Methods of this form can reproduce any unitary $U = e^{iH}$ for which $H$ can be expressed as a sum of tensor products of Paulis. Since we have shown previously that all matrices can be expressed in this way, this is sufficient to show that we can reproduce all unitaries. Though other methods may be better in practice, the main concept to take away from this chapter is that there is certainly a way to reproduce all multi-qubit unitaries using only the basic operations found in Qiskit. Quantum universality can be achieved!\n",
    "\n",
    "This gate set is not the only one that can achieve universality. For example it can be shown that just the Hadamard and Toffoli are sufficient for universality. Multiple other gates sets have also been considered and been proven universal, each motivated by different routes toward acheiving the gates fault-tolerantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything we have discussed in this book follows the circuit model of computation. However, the circuit model is not the only universal model of quantum computation. Other forms of quantum computation such as adiabatic quantum computing or measurement based quantum computing exist. The fact that they are universal means that it has been proven that there is a mapping in polynomial time and resources from the circuit model to these other models of computation. These other models often leverage other quantum mechanical properties in order to perform their computation. While these other forms of quantum computation exist, it is important to note that the benefits of each concern only physical and hardware problems. Since a universal model of quantum computation can perform any quantum algorithm, we need only stick with the circuit model and can ignore other universal models for our discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other forms of quantum computation that are not universal, but are applicable to specific applications. For example quantum annealing may be useful for optimization and sampling problems. Annealing is the process of heating a metal to a high temperature and then allowing it to cool down slowly. This process causes molten metal to flow over the surface of the metal piece and redistribute itself; changing many properties of the metal in question. Quantum annealing is analogous to the physical process of annealing in some sense. It involves encoding problems into an energy landscape of sorts and then letting a quantum state explore the landscape. While normal waves may get trapped in troughs which are lower than their surroundings (local minima), quantum effects increase the speed at which the quantum states find the true lowest point on the landscape (global minima)."
