# About This Section

At this point in the textbook, the reader can choose to continue learning about applied quantum algorithms or skip to ‘Investigating Quantum Hardware with Quantum Circuits’.
In 4.1, we will demonstrate quantum algorithms applied to real world problems. In section 4.2, we will cover more recent quantum algorithms to help bring the reader up to date with more recent developments in the field.
