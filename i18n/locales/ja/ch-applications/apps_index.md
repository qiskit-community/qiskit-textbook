# About This Section

Itâ€™s important to see the wide range of applications of quantum algorithms, but as we have seen, understanding the problem can be as difficult as understanding the algorithm that solves it. The topics in this chapter range from chemistry to machine learning, these are large and complex topics in their own right and the Qiskit textbook is not able to provide a full introduction for them. While we have tried to include the necessary background to explain the algorithms, these explanations are not rigorous introductions to the fields and the pages will inevitably touch upon concepts that are outside the scope of the textbook. 


It is recommended that you use this section to see how the algorithms we have learnt so far can be applied to real problems, and that you read more deeply on the topics that interest you the most.
