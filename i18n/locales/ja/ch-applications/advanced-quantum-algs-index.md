# About This Section

At this point in the textbook, the reader can choose to continue learning about more advanced quantum algorithms or skip to ‘Investigating Quantum Hardware with Quantum Circuits’. 

Within this chapter, the reader can also choose which topics they would like to cover and cover them in whichever order they prefer. In chapter 4.1, we will cover algorithms to popular problems, that on future machines will offer significant speed up over their classical counterparts. In section 4.2, we will demonstrate quantum algorithms applied to real world problems. In section 4.3, we will cover more recent quantum algorithms to help bring the reader up to date with more recent developments in the field.
