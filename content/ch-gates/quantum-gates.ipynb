    "To manipulate an input state we need to apply the basic operations of quantum computing. These are known as quantum gates. Here we'll give an introduction to some of the most fundamental gates in quantum computing. Most of those we'll be looking at act only on a single qubit. This means that their actions can be understood in terms of the Bloch sphere.\n",

    "### The Pauli operators\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest quantum gates are the Paulis: $X$, $Y$ and $Z$. Their action is to perform a half rotation of the Bloch sphere around the x, y and z axes. They therefore have effects similar to the classical NOT gate or bit-flip. Specifically, the action of the $X$ gate on the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ is\n",

Typically we will use the style of $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ when referring to gates in text or equations, and `x`, `y` and `z` when writing Qiskit code."
