    "For every possible realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing, there is a set of quantum operations that are most straightforward to realize. Often these consist of multiple so-called Clifford gates, combined with a few single-qubit gates that do not belong to the Clifford group. In this section we'll introduce these concepts, in preparation for showing that they are universal."

    "This gate is expressed above using outer products, as described in the last section. When expressed in this form, its famous effect becomes obvious: it takes $|0\\rangle$, and rotates it to $|+\\rangle$. More generally, we can say it rotates the basis states of the z measurement, $\\{ |0\\rangle,|1\\rangle \\}$, to the basis states of the x measurement, $\\{ |+\\rangle,|-\\rangle \\}$, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effect of the Hadamard is to move information around a qubit. It swaps any information that would previously be accessed by an x measurement with that accessed by a z measurement. Indeed, one of the most important jobs of the Hadamard is to do exactly this. We use it when wanting to make an x measurement, given that we can only physically make z measurements.\n",

    "\n",

    "By doing a Hadamard before and after an $X$, we cause the action it previously applied to the z basis states to be transferred to the x basis states instead. The combined effect is then identical to that of a $Z$. Similarly, we can create an $X$ from Hadamards and a $Z$.\n",

    "The property of transforming Paulis into other Paulis is the defining feature of Clifford gates. Stated explicitly for the single-qubit case: if $U$ is a Clifford and $P$ is a Pauli, $U P U^{\\dagger}$ will also be a Pauli. For Hermitian gates, like the Hadamard, we can simply use $U P U$.\n",

    "\n",
    "For multiple-qubit Clifford gates, the defining property is that they transform tensor products of Paulis to other tensor products of Paulis. For example, the most prominent two-qubit Clifford gate is the CNOT. The property of this that we will make use of in this chapter is\n",

    "The process of sandwiching a matrix between a unitary and its Hermitian conjugate is known as conjugation by that unitary. This process transforms the eigenstates of the matrix, but leaves the eigenvalues unchanged.
