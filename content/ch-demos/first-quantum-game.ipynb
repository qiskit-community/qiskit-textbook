    "\n",
    "To make full use of the game engine, you'll need all the details of how it works. It gives us the ability to make games for a low-pixel screen (8x8 by default), controlled by a D-pad and five buttons. Note that the screen will only update when a button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game engine is all based around the `QiskitGameEngine` object. You can call this whaetever you like. In the following we will call it `engine`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The screen\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixels can be addressed in the functions using `engine.screen`. The pixel at position (x,y) is adressed as `engine.screen.pixel[x,y]`. It has three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `set_color(color)` - The argument `color` is a string: either `'grey'`, `'green'`, `'blue'`, `'orange'` or `'red'`.\n",
    "* `set_brightness(bright)` - The argument `bright` is a Boolean value: `False` for dim and `True` for bright.\n",
    "* `set_text(text)` - The argument is text to be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that most pixels won't contain more than a few characters. A larger piece of text can be written on the long pixel at the bottom of the screen, which is accessed with `engine.screen.pixel['text']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The controller\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller is accessed using `engine.controller`. Its buttons are addressed using the keys `'down'`, `'up'`, `'left'`, `'right'`, `'A'`, `'B'`, `'X'`, `'Y'` and `'next'`. Each is a Jupyter widget button object. Pressing any of these buttons will cause the `next_frame` function to run. Use the `value` attribute of each button to determine whether the button has been pressed (`True`) or not (`False`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The game loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Games are made by defining two functions, `start` and `next_frame`. The `start` function runs when the game begins, and `next_frame` runs every time a button is pressed to move the game along. Both should have a single argument: the class `engine`. All parameters required for the game should be defined as attributes to the `engine` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is started by initiating the `QiskitGameEngine` object with the `start` and `next_frame` functions. You can also choose a size other than the default 8x8 grid using the keyword argument `L`.\n",
