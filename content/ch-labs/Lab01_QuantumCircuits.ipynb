Primarily this involves the addition of swap gates so that two-qubit gates in the circuit map to those pairs of qubits on the device that can actually perform these gates. The following cell shows the AND gate represented as a Toffoli gate decomposed into single- and two-qubit gates, which are the only types of gate that can be run on IBM hardware.  Provided that CNOT gates can be performed between all three qubits, a triangle topology, no other gates are required."

Note that the addition of swaps to match the device topology, and optimizations for reducing the length of a circuit are at odds with each other. In what follows we will make use of `initial_layout` that allows us to pick the qubits on a device used for the computation and `optimization_level`, an argument that allows selecting from internal defaults for circuit swap mapping and optimization methods to perform.\n",

Circuit depth is defined in detail [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/circuit.html) (See the Supplementray Information and click the Quantum Circuit Properties tab). Circuit depth is proportional to the number of gates in a circuit, and loosly corresponds to the runtime of the circuit on hardware.   Therefore, circuit depth is an easy to compute metric that can be used to estimate the fidelity of an executed circuit.\n",
