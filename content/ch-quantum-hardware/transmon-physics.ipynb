    "## 1. Multi-level Quantum Systems as Qubits <a id='mlqsaq'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits are fundamentally about the physics of two-level systems. One such example of a purely two-level system is the spin of an electron (or any other spin-$1/2$ particle): it can either point up or down, and we label these states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, respectively. Historically, the reason the $|0\\rangle$ state is at the \"north pole\" of the Bloch sphere is that this is the lower-energy state when a magnetic field is applied in the $+\\hat{z}$ direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another such two-level system occurs in the first type of superconducting qubit discovered: the [Cooper Pair Box](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9904003v1.pdf). The reason there is no electrical resistance in superconductors is that electrons combine as Cooper pairs, which take energy to break up (and that energy is not available thermally at low temperatures), because they are effectively attracted to each other. This situation is quite counterintuitive, because electrons are both negatively-charged, they should repel each other! However, in many material systems effective interactions can be mediated by collective effects: one can think of the electrons as being attracted to the wake of other electrons in the lattice of positive charge. The Cooper Pair Box consists of a superconducting island that possesses an extra Cooper pair of charge $2e$ ($|0\\rangle$) or does not ($|1\\rangle$). These states can be manipulated by voltages on tunnel junctions, and is indeed periodic with \"gate\" voltage control, so it is indeed a two-level system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits encoded as charge states are particularly sensitive to *charge noise*, and this is true of the Cooper Pair Box. What about using other types of superconducing circuits as qubits? Many other quantum systems are not two-level systems, such as atoms that each feature unique spectral lines (energy transitions) that are used by astonomers to determine the composition of our universe. By effectively isolating and controlling just two levels, such as the ground and first excited state of an atom, then you could treat it as a qubit. The solution to the charge noise problem of the Cooper Pair Box hedged on designing a qubit with higher-order energy levels: the [transmon](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0703002.pdf). (The name is derived from *transmission-line shunted plasma oscillation* qubit). By sacrificing anharmonicity (the difference between the $|0\\rangle \\to |1\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle \\to |2\\rangle$ transition frequencies, see section on [Accessing Higher Energy States](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-quantum-hardware/accessing_higher_energy_states.html)), charge noise is suppressed while still allowing the lowest two levels to be addressed as a qubit. Now the quantum states are encoded in oscillations of Cooper Pairs across a tunnel junction between two superconducting islands, with the excited $|1\\rangle$ state oscillating at a high frequency than the ground $|0\\rangle$."

    "Hamiltonians and Lagrangians are functions involving the energies of massive objects and have a rich history in the dynamics of classical systems. They still serve as a template for \"quantizing\" objects, including the transmon.

The conjugate variable to our generalized coordinate is then calculated, and will end up being charge in our case (usually momentum in the classical case).

    "Applying an electric drive field $\\vec{E}(t) = \\vec{E}_0 e^{-i\\omega_d t} + \\vec{E}_0^* e^{i\\omega_d t}$ to the transmon introduces a dipole interaction between the transmon and microwave field. Here we treat the transmon as a qubit for simplicity, so the Hamiltonian is the sum of the qubit Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$ and drive Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_d$,\n",

This also allows us to use the Pauli raising/lowering operators $\\sigma^\\pm = (1/2)(\\sigma^x \\mp i\\sigma^y)$ that have the effect $\\sigma^+ |0\\rangle = |1\\rangle$ and $\\sigma^+ |1\\rangle = |0\\rangle$. (Note that this definition reflects that we are using *qubit* raising/lower operators instead of those for *spin*. For the reason discussed in [Section 1](#mlqsaq), $|0\\rangle \\equiv |\\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle \\equiv |\\downarrow \\rangle$ so the raising and lowering operators are inverted). Now since the field will excite and de-excite the qubit, we define the dipole operator $\\vec{d} = \\vec{d}_0 \\sigma^+ + \\vec{d}_0^* \\sigma^-$.
