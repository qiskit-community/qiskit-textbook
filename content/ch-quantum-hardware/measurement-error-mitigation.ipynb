    "The effect of noise is to give us outputs that are not quite correct. The effect of noise that occurs throughout a computation will be quite complex in general, as one would have to consider how each gate transforms the effect of each error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simpler form of noise is that occuring during final measurement. At this point, the only job remaining in the circuit is to extract a bit string as an output. For an $n$ qubit final measurement, this means extracting one of the $2^n$ possible $n$ bit strings. As a simple model of the noise in this process, we can imagine that the measurement first selects one of these outputs in a perfect and noiseless manner, and then noise subsequently causes this perfect output to be randomly perturbed before it is returned to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this model, it is very easy to determine exactly what the effects of measurement errors are. We can simply prepare each of the $2^n$ possible basis states, immediately measure them, and see what probability exists for each outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will first create a simple noise model, which randomly flips each bit in an output with probability $p$."
