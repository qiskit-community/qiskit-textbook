    "Now, we determine the qubit frequency to better precision. This is done using a Ramsey pulse sequence. In this pulse sequence, we first apply a $\\pi/2$ (\"pi over two\") pulse, wait some time $\\Delta t$, and then apply another $\\pi/2$ pulse. Since we are measuring the signal from the qubit at the same frequency as the pulses, we should observe oscillations at the difference in frequency between the applied pulses and the qubit."
