    "To continue further in this course, we need a way of writing down qubit states. You will see by the end of chapter 2, that using only vectors and matrices we can write down the state of any set of qubits and any quantum operation. **Before you continue**, you should be comfortable with complex numbers. Knowledge of linear algebra will help, although there are reminders of important concepts scattered throughout. If you need a more in-depth explanation or refresher, you can check out the mathematics prerequisite [here](../ch-prerequisites/linear_algebra.ipynb).\n",

    "In quantum physics we use _statevectors_ to describe the state of our system. This is different from classical physics where we generally just use numbers. For example, say we wanted to describe the position of a car along a track, this is a classical system so we could use a number $x$:\n",

    "This isn’t limited to position, we could also keep a statevector of all the possible speeds the car could have, and all the possible colours the car could be. With classical systems (like the car example above), this is a silly thing to do as it requires keeping huge vectors when we only really need one number. But as we will see in this chapter, statevectors happen to be a very good way of keeping track of quantum systems, including quantum computers.\n",

    "\n",
    "    c = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "This is fine, as a classical bit always has a definite state. With qubits however, this restriction is lifted and we have probabilities of measuring different states. Each state a qubit can be measured in has an _amplitude_ (a complex number), and we need to keep track of these complex numbers. A qubit is a two-level system, so upon measurement* we will find it in one of two states:\n",

Notice that we denote a column vector by enclosing it between the $|$ and $\\rangle$ symbols. The state's amplitude is related to the probability of measuring the qubit in that state.

    "The symbols $\\langle$ and $|$ tell us $\\langle \\psi |$ is a row vector. In quantum mechanics we call the column vectors _kets_ and the row vectors _bras._ Together they make up _bra-ket_ notation.

    "    <p>There are different ways to multiply vectors, here we use the <i>inner product</i>. The inner product is a generalisation of the <i>dot product</i> which you may already be familiar with. In this guide, we use the inner product between a bra (row vector) and a ket (column vector), and it follows this rule:\n",

    "#### Warning!\n",
    "When first learning about qubit states, it's easy to confuse the qubits _statevector_ with it's _Bloch vector_. Remember the statevector is the vector disucssed in [1.1](#notation), that holds the amplitudes for the two states our qubit can be in. The Bloch vector is a visualisation tool that maps the 2D, complex statevector onto real, 3D space."
