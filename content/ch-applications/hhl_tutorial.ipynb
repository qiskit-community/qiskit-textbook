    "Linear system of equations are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering, and, in every sector of research, manipulating matrices efficiently has become a massive area of interest. They arise naturally in many real-life applications in a wide range of areas, such as in the solution of Partial Differential Equations, the calibration of financial models, fluid simulation or numerical field calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most classical methods for matrix manipulation do work in polynomial time, (unlike the classical solutions to the Deutsch-Jozsa and search problems that we've seen earlier). Unfortunately, as data analysis becomes more and more powerful, the size of these matrices can make even polynomial time too long. \n",
    "\n",
    "Developed by Aram Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, and Seth Lloyd, HHL is a quantum algorithm that approximates a function of the solution vector of a linear system of equations, with running time complexity of $\\mathcal{ O }(\\log(N)s^{2}\\kappa^{2}/\\epsilon)$<sup>[1](#hhl)</sup>. This time reduction has significant implications for the speedup of many machine learning algorithms on quantum computers.\n",

    "The given Linear system has to have a low condition number ${\\displaystyle \\kappa },$ and the Matrix $A$ must be $s$-sparse. This means $A$ must have at most $s$ non-zero entries per row or column. Solving an $s$-sparse system of size $N$ with a classical computer requires $\\mathcal{ O }(Ns\\kappa\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ running time using the conjugate gradient method <sup>[2](#conjgrad)</sup>. Here, $\\epsilon$ deonotes the accuracy of the approximation.\n",
    " \n",
    "It is assumed that the user of the algorithm is interested in the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector, instead of the values of the solution vector itself. So, it assumes that the user is not interested in the values of ${\\displaystyle {\\overrightarrow {x}}}$ itself, but rather the result of applying some operator ${\\displaystyle M}$ onto x, ${\\displaystyle \\langle x|M|x\\rangle }$. Hence, while the classical algorithm returns the full solution, the HHL can only approximate functions of the solution vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Matrix ${\\displaystyle A}$ should be Hermitian so that it can be converted into a unitary operator, under the assumptions of efficient oracles for loading the data, Hamiltonian simulation and computing a function of the solution. \n",

    "The time required for a least-squares fit (a continuous function to model a set of discrete points) has been found to become very large as the amount of discrete points increases. However, a research group has developed a quantum algorithm that incorporates HHL to solve many cases of least-squares efficiently, eliminating the need for the previously best higher-complexity algorithm <sup>[3](#ml)</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, HHL is thought to be massively useful in machine learning, where classical algorithms are limited by a polynomial dependence on the volume of data and dimensions of the space. One specific use for HHL in machine learning is in an optimized linear or non-linear binary classifier, or support vector machine. Research has shown that a quantum support vector machine can be used for big data classification and achieve an exponential speedup over classical computers <sup>[4](#data)</sup> . A quantum algorithm has also been developed for Bayesian training of deep neural networks, with an exponential speedup over classical training due to the use of HHL.\n",

    "In the previous section we ran the standard algorithm provided in Qiskit and saw that it uses $7$ qubits, has a depth of ~$100$ gates and requires a total of $54$ CNOT gates. These numbers are not feasible for the current available hardware, therefore we need to decrease these quantities. In particular, the goal will be to reduce the number of CNOTs by a factor of $5$ since they have worse fidelity than single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we can reduce the number of qubits to $4$ as was the original statement of the problem: the Qiskit method was written for a general problem and that is why it requires $3$ additional auxiliary qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, solely decreasing the number of gates and qubits will not give a good approximation to the solution on real hardware. This is because there are two sources of errors: those that occur during the run of the circuit and readout errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit provides a module to mitigate the readout errors by individually preparing and measuring all basis states, a detailed treatment on the topic can be found in the paper by Dewes et al.<sup>[4](#readouterr)</sup> To deal with the errors occurring during the run of the circuit, Richardson extrapolation can be used to calculate the error to the zero limit by running the circuit three times, each replacing each CNOT gate by $1$, $3$ and $5$ CNOTs respectively<sup>[5](#richardson)</sup>. The idea is that theoretically the three circuits should produce the same result, but in real hardware adding CNOTs means amplifying the error. Since we know that we have obtained results with an amplified error, and we can estimate by how much the error was amplified in each case, we can recombine the quantities to obtain a new result that is a closer approximation to the analytic solution than any of the previous obtained values.\n",
