    "Systems of linear equations arise naturally in many real-life applications in a wide range of areas, such as in the solution of Partial Differential Equations, the calibration of financial models, fluid simulation or numerical field calculation. The problem can be defined as, given a matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}$ and a vector $\\vec{b}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N}$, find $\\vec{x}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N}$ satisfying $A\\vec{x}=\\vec{b}.$\n",

    "For example, take $N=2$, \n",

    "A system of linear equations is called $s$-sparse if $A$ has at most $s$ non-zero entries per row or column. Solving an $s$-sparse system of size $N$ with a classical computer requires $\\mathcal{ O }(Ns\\kappa\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ running time using the conjugate gradient method <sup>[1](#conjgrad)</sup>. Here $\\kappa$ denotes the condition number of the system and $\\epsilon$ the accuracy of the approximation.\n",

This is an exponential speed up in the size of the system, however one crucial remark to keep in mind is that the classical algorithm returns the full solution, while the HHL can only approximate functions of the solution vector."

    "In the previous section we ran the standard algorithm provided in Qiskit and saw that it uses $7$ qubits, has a depth of $326$ gates and requires a total of $174$ CNOT gates. These numbers are not feasible for the current available hardware, therefore we need to decrease these quantities. In particular, the goal will be to reduce the number of CNOTs by a factor of $10$ since they have worse fidelity than single-qubit gates. Furthermore, we can reduce the number of qubits to $4$ as was the original statement of the problem: the Qiskit method was written for a general problem and that is why it requires $3$ additional ancilla qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, solely decreasing the number of gates and qubits will not give a good approximation to the solution on real hardware. This is because there are two sources of errors: those that occur during the run of the circuit and readout errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit provides a module to mitigate the readout errors by individually preparing and measuring all basis states, a detailed treatment on the topic can be found in the paper by Dewes et al.<sup>[3](#readouterr)</sup> To deal with the errors occurring during the run of the circuit, Richardson extrapolation can be used to calculate the error to the zero limit by running the circuit three times, each replacing each CNOT gate by $1$, $3$ and $5$ CNOTs respectively<sup>[4](#richardson)</sup>. The idea is that theoretically the three circuits should produce the same result, but in real hardware adding CNOTs means amplifying the error. Since we know that we have obtained results with an amplified error, and we can estimate by how much the error was amplified in each case, we can recombine the quantities to obtain a new result that is a closer approximation to the analytic solution than any of the previous obtained values.\n",
